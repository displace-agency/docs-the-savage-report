# Workflows Location

This folder stores reusable workflow files for documentation operations (moved out of `.github/workflows` to keep this repo as a template/admin source). When you want CI to run in a target project, copy any workflow from here to `.github/workflows/` in that repo.

Included:
- `link-check.yml`: Enforces external links open in a new tab by running the link checker.
