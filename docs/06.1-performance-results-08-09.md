## How We Measured

- Tools: PageSpeed Insights (single-page Lighthouse), Webflow publish previews, real-device tests
- Metrics: Overall score, LCP, CLS, TBT
- Method: Change one variable at a time; re-measure; keep deltas conservative (ranges reflect multiple runs)

<a id="what-we-tried-and-findings"></a>
## What We Tried and Findings
Concrete experiments, measurement approach, and outcomes. Deltas are approximate and averaged across multiple runs.

- Image compression tightening (JPEG → WebP; max ~150KB → ~120KB)
  - Hypothesis: Lower bytes would reduce LCP on product/listing pages.
  - Change: Re-exported hero and collection thumbnails at smaller dimensions where safe; enforced WebP across assets.
  - Result: LCP improved ~120–200ms on desktop; ~180–250ms on mobile. No visible quality loss on key assets.

- Responsive image sizing review
  - Hypothesis: Some images were over-provisioned on mobile breakpoints.
  - Change: Adjusted `srcset`/breakpoints to better match device widths; ensured backgrounds use appropriately sized images.
  - Result: Mobile Lighthouse +2–3 points; fewer bytes over network on 3G simulation.

- Lazy loading audit
  - Hypothesis: Some critical-above-fold images might be delayed; others below the fold should be deferred.
  - Change: Ensured above-the-fold hero is eager; non-critical images set to lazy; reduced eager assets to only LCP image and brand mark.
  - Result: LCP stabilized; CLS unaffected; small TBT reduction from fewer early decodes.

- Homepage background video strategy
  - Hypothesis: Autoplay background video increased initial bytes and CPU.
  - Change: Disabled autoplay on mobile, delivered a poster image first, deferred video load until interaction/viewport.
  - Result: Mobile score +4–6 points on video-heavy sections; reduced TBT spikes on mid-range devices.

- Code minification and asset ordering
  - Hypothesis: Unminified assets and render-blocking order added delay before first render.
  - Change: Enabled minify HTML/CSS/JS in Webflow; moved non-critical scripts to end; ensured critical CSS is inlined.
  - Result: TBT down ~30–60ms; First Contentful Paint slightly earlier; score +1–2.

- Prefetch/preload tuning
  - Hypothesis: Preloading next likely navigations would improve perceived speed beyond the first page.
  - Change: Enabled link-hover prefetch; limited automatic preloads to high-probability routes to avoid waste.
  - Result: Repeat navigation feels instant; Lighthouse unaffected (single-page test) but UX improved.

- Caching validation
  - Hypothesis: CDN and browser cache could reduce repeat-visit cost.
  - Change: Verified CDN and asset caching headers; confirmed hashed assets; validated service worker offline capability where applicable.
  - Result: Repeat-visit loads significantly faster; not fully captured by PSI single-run, but observed in real-device tests.

- Pagination vs. infinite scroll ("Load More")
  - Hypothesis: Reducing initial DOM and image payload improves initial performance.
  - Change: Implemented "Load More" on collection pages to fetch subsequent items on demand.
  - Result: Initial page weight reduced; interaction cost deferred; measured +2–3 Lighthouse on collection pages.

- CLS audit (fonts and aspect ratios)
  - Hypothesis: Late-loading fonts and missing media aspect ratios may cause layout shift.
  - Change: Ensured image/video aspect ratio boxes; validated font-display and fallback stack.
  - Result: CLS consistently in the Good range (<0.1) across templates.

## Next Actions

- Consider serving even smaller hero image variants on narrow devices if design allows.
- Explore replacing background video with high-quality animated poster on mobile only.
- Validate deferring any third-party scripts that are not strictly necessary for initial render.
- Add periodic synthetic checks to alert on regressions after content changes.
