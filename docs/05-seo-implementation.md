## What We Implemented (Concise)

### 1) Structured Data (Schema Markup)
- Prepared JSON-LD for Product, Organization, Local Business, and Website
- Currently inactive to avoid conflicts with the performance optimizer; ready to enable after compatibility validation
- Goal: enable rich results (stars, price, brand info) without compromising speed

### 2) SEO-Optimized Content & Metadata
- Added SEO text blocks on collection pages (human-first, keyword-informed)
- Implemented consistent, brand-first meta titles and optimized descriptions
- Added Open Graph tags for improved social sharing
- Standardized URL slugs using best practices

### 3) Technical SEO
- Enabled and verified auto XML sitemap
- Configured robots.txt for efficient crawling (verified in GSC)
- Implemented self-referencing canonicals sitewide
- Ensured HTTPS across domains with proper www/non-www handling
- Improved site architecture ("Shop All" index, optimized CMS collections, staged non-core pages)

### 4) Mobile & Performance
- Mobile layout improvements (e.g., simplified homepage header for speed)
- Core Web Vitals improved with performance work (see performance doc)

## Site Architecture (At a Glance)
```
Customers → Webflow (Pages, CMS) → Smootify (Bridge) → Shopify (Products, Orders)
                           ↘ XML Sitemap / robots.txt ↙      
```

## Core Web Vitals Snapshot
- Track with PageSpeed Insights (mobile/desktop) and internal monitoring
- Key metrics: LCP < 2.5s, CLS < 0.1, INP < 200ms
- Evidence: [PSI Report](https://pagespeed.web.dev/report?url=https://the-savage-report.com)

## Sitemaps in Google Search Console (Admin Reference)
This is where you can review and manage sitemap status over time (status, last read, discovered URLs). After publishing significant changes, revisit this page to resubmit if needed.

## Schema Markup (Re‑enabled)
- Removed the Performance Optimizer NoSchema blocker
- Created a new inline script “Active Schema Markup” (v2.0.0)
  - Organization, WebSite, LocalBusiness schemas
  - Loaded in the site header for consistent coverage
- Location: Webflow → Project Settings → Custom Code → Head
  - Link: [webflow.com/dashboard/sites/savage-report-we/custom-code](https://webflow.com/dashboard/sites/savage-report-we/custom-code)
- Next steps after any change:
  - Publish the site (Webflow)
  - Validate with [Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results) and [Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console)
