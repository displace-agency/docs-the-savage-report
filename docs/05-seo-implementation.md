### 2) SEO-Optimized Content & Metadata

- Implemented consistent, brand-first meta titles and optimized descriptions
- Added Open Graph tags for improved social sharing
- Standardized URL slugs using best practices

### 3) Technical SEO
- Enabled and verified auto XML sitemap
- Configured robots.txt for efficient crawling (verified in GSC)
- Implemented self-referencing canonicals sitewide
- Ensured HTTPS across domains with proper www/non-www handling
- Improved site architecture ("Shop All" index, optimized CMS collections, staged non-core pages)

### 4) Mobile & Performance
- Mobile layout improvements (e.g., simplified homepage header for speed)
- Core Web Vitals improved with performance work (see performance doc)
