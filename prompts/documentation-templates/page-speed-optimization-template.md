# Page Speed Optimization Documentation Template Prompt

## Purpose
This prompt guides the creation of page speed optimization documentation for non-technical clients. The documentation should explain completed work, not suggest future improvements.

## Documentation Guidelines

### Target Audience
- Non-technical business owners
- Marketing teams
- Stakeholders who need to understand the value of the work done

### Structure Requirements

1. **Start with Summary Table**
   - What was done
   - Impact/Value
   - Implementation date
   - Visual status indicators (‚úÖ ‚ùå üîÑ)

2. **Explain Technical Work in Simple Terms**
   - Use "What we did" / "Why it matters" format
   - Include real-world analogies when helpful
   - Avoid technical jargon
   - Focus on business benefits

3. **Visual Elements**
   - Use tables for quick scanning
   - Include before/after metrics
   - Add visual indicators (emojis/icons) for status
   - Break up text with clear sections

4. **Content Rules**
   - Document ONLY completed work
   - NO "next steps" or "recommendations"
   - NO checklists for future tasks
   - Focus on achievements and impact
   - Include implementation dates for accountability

5. **Business Impact Section**
   - Translate technical improvements to business metrics
   - Show percentage improvements
   - Connect to revenue/conversion when possible
   - Use simple comparisons (e.g., "40% faster = 2 seconds saved")

## Key Principles

1. **Clarity Over Complexity**
   - If a grandmother can't understand it, simplify it

2. **Value-Focused**
   - Always connect technical work to business outcomes

3. **Factual Documentation**
   - Document what WAS done, not what COULD be done

4. **Visual Hierarchy**
   - Make it scannable
   - Important information should jump out

5. **No Technical Debt**
   - Don't create expectations for future work
   - This is a record of achievements, not a roadmap

## Example Explanations

### Good Example:
"**What we did:** Compressed all product images to load 70% faster
**Why it matters:** Customers see products immediately instead of waiting 3 seconds"

### Bad Example:
"Implemented WebP format with fallback to JPEG using srcset attributes for responsive image delivery"

## Measurement Focus
- Always include metrics when available
- Use percentages for improvements
- Show time saved in seconds (not milliseconds)
- Connect to business KPIs when possible
