## 🔗 How to Use This Hub
1. Browse by category to find the relevant topic
2. Use search (Ctrl/Cmd + F) for specifics
3. Follow step-by-step instructions where provided
4. Reference official docs linked in each article

## 📝 Article Format
- Overview (what/why)
- Quick summary table (what/where/why/links)
- Steps or examples (concise)
- Best practices
- Troubleshooting
- Resources (official links)

## 🗃️ Assets (Images & Media)
- Purpose: Assets complement the text; they’re not “proof.” Use them to illustrate where to find settings or what to expect.
- Placement: Store images under a flat `assets/` folder (no nested category folders).
- Naming: Kebab-case, descriptive, include date if relevant. Examples:
  - `gsc-sitemaps-example-2025-08.png`
  - `webflow-custom-code-head-location.png`
- Referencing: Use relative paths in articles, e.g. `![Alt text](../../assets/gsc-sitemaps-example-2025-08.png)`.
- Client-specific screenshots belong in `/docs/` articles, not in the Knowledge Hub.
- Prefer hosted links only if the asset must be external; otherwise keep in-repo.

## ✍️ Writing Philosophy
- Be concise and scannable (tables and bullets first)
- Be value-driven (explain the business impact)
- Use live links to verify (admin, public endpoints, official docs)
- Generic, client-agnostic (no client-specific details here)

## 🚀 Quick Links
- Webflow University (https://university.webflow.com/)
- Google Search Console (https://search.google.com/search-console)
- PageSpeed Insights (https://pagespeed.web.dev/)

## 📖 Contributing
1. Create a new `.md` file in the appropriate category
2. Follow the format above and keep it concise
3. Add practical examples and links; include assets where helpful and name them properly
4. Update these guidelines with a link to your new article
