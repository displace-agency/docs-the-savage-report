## What is Page Speed Optimization?

Page speed optimization is the process of making websites load faster through various technical improvements. It's like tuning a car engine - many small adjustments work together to create optimal performance.

## Why Page Speed Matters

### Business Impact
- **Conversion Rates**: Every 1-second delay can reduce conversions by 7%
- **Bounce Rates**: 53% of mobile users leave if a page takes over 3 seconds
- **SEO Rankings**: Google uses page speed as a ranking factor
- **User Experience**: Faster sites create happier customers

### The 3-Second Rule
Research shows that users expect pages to load in under 3 seconds. After that:
- 40% will abandon the website
- 79% won't return to a slow site
- 44% will tell others about their bad experience

## Core Optimization Techniques

### 1. Image Optimization
**What it is:** Reducing image file sizes without losing visual quality

**Methods:**
- Compression (reducing file size)
- Format optimization (WebP, AVIF)
- Responsive images (different sizes for different devices)
- Lazy loading (load only when needed)

**Impact:** Images often represent 60-70% of page weight

### 2. Code Minification
**What it is:** Removing unnecessary characters from code

**What gets removed:**
- Spaces and line breaks
- Comments
- Redundant code

**Result:** 20-30% smaller file sizes

### 3. Browser Caching
**What it is:** Storing files locally on visitor's device

**Benefits:**
- Faster return visits
- Reduced server load
- Lower bandwidth usage

### 4. Content Delivery Network (CDN)
**What it is:** Distributing content across global servers

**How it works:**
- Content served from nearest location
- Reduces physical distance data travels
- Provides redundancy and reliability

### 5. Lazy Loading
**What it is:** Loading content only when needed

**Applications:**
- Images below the fold
- Videos
- Third-party widgets
- Comments sections

### 6. Critical CSS
**What it is:** Inlining essential styles for immediate rendering

**Process:**
1. Identify above-the-fold styles
2. Inline critical CSS in HTML
3. Load remaining CSS asynchronously

## Performance Metrics Explained

### Core Web Vitals

#### LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)
- **Measures:** Loading performance
- **Good:** Under 2.5 seconds
- **What it means:** How fast the main content appears

#### FID (First Input Delay)
- **Measures:** Interactivity
- **Good:** Under 100 milliseconds
- **What it means:** How quickly page responds to clicks

#### CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)
- **Measures:** Visual stability
- **Good:** Under 0.1
- **What it means:** How much content jumps around

### Other Important Metrics

#### Time to First Byte (TTFB)
- Server response time
- Should be under 600ms

#### First Contentful Paint (FCP)
- When first text/image appears
- Target: Under 1.8 seconds

#### Time to Interactive (TTI)
- When page becomes fully interactive
- Target: Under 3.8 seconds

## Modern Optimization Strategies

### 1. Progressive Enhancement
Build basic functionality first, then add features for capable browsers

### 2. Resource Hints
```html
<link rel="preconnect"> - Establish early connections
<link rel="prefetch"> - Fetch resources for likely next page
<link rel="preload"> - Load critical resources early
```

### 3. JavaScript Optimization
- Code splitting (load only what's needed)
- Tree shaking (remove unused code)
- Async/defer loading
- Module bundling

### 4. Performance Budgets
Setting limits for:
- Page weight (e.g., max 2MB)
- Load time (e.g., under 3 seconds)
- Number of requests (e.g., max 50)

## Testing Tools

### Free Tools
- **Google PageSpeed Insights**: Overall performance score
- **GTmetrix**: Detailed waterfall analysis
- **WebPageTest**: Advanced testing options
- **Chrome DevTools**: Built-in browser testing

### Key Metrics to Track
- Performance score (0-100)
- Load time
- Page size
- Number of requests
- Core Web Vitals

## Common Performance Issues

### 1. Unoptimized Images
- **Problem:** Large, uncompressed images
- **Solution:** Compression, proper formats, lazy loading

### 2. Render-Blocking Resources
- **Problem:** CSS/JS blocking page display
- **Solution:** Async loading, critical CSS

### 3. Too Many HTTP Requests
- **Problem:** Each request adds latency
- **Solution:** Combine files, use sprites, implement HTTP/2

### 4. No Caching Strategy
- **Problem:** Resources reload every visit
- **Solution:** Implement browser and server caching

### 5. Unminified Code
- **Problem:** Unnecessary file size
- **Solution:** Enable minification

## Platform-Specific Considerations

### Webflow
- Built-in CDN (Fastly)
- Automatic image optimization
- Minification settings
- Hosting optimization

### Shopify
- Liquid template optimization
- App performance impact
- Theme optimization
- Image handling

### WordPress
- Plugin optimization
- Database queries
- Theme efficiency
- Hosting quality

## The Business Case for Speed

### ROI of Performance
- **Amazon:** 1% faster = 1% more revenue
- **Walmart:** 1 second improvement = 2% conversion increase
- **Google:** 0.5 second delay = 20% traffic drop

### Mobile-First Performance
- 60% of searches from mobile
- Mobile users have higher bounce rates
- Connection speeds vary greatly
- Battery life considerations
