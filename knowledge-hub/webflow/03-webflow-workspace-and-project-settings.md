# Webflow Workspace and Project Settings

## What This Is & Why It Matters

> Key tip: You don’t need a workspace subscription to run a live site. A workspace plan is helpful for inviting collaborators and duplicating projects at scale.

### Notes & Best Practices

- Use staging for review; publish to production when approved.
- Default to www for your production domain for SEO consistency.
- After setting redirects, always re‑publish to activate changes.
- Test performance toggles before/after enabling to avoid breaking interactions.
- Keep backups before major changes; they are fast to restore.
