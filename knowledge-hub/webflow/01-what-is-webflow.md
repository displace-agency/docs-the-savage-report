# What is Webflow and How Does It Work?

## What This Is & Why It Matters
Webflow is a visual website builder that lets Displace Agency design and ship custom, professional sites without writing code. We design visually; Webflow generates clean HTML/CSS/JS. Clients get an easy way to edit content without breaking layouts.
